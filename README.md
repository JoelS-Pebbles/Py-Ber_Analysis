# Py-Ber_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a DataFrame showing the ride_sharing data by city type. Then to create a line chart that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Lastly, to submit an analysis.

## Results
The  rural cities had the lowest amount of rides and drivers but had the highest average fare per driver and average fare per ride. However it had the lowest total fares of the three cities by a substantial amount. The suburban cities were in the middle of the three for all of the metrics. Suburban cities had far more riders and drivers which dorve the total fares up by a lot as well. The urban cities had by far the highest number of riders and drivers. Even with the lowest fare per driver and fare per rider, urban cities had the high total fares by far.
