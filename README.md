# Py-Ber_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a DataFrame showing the ride_sharing data by city type. Then to create a line chart that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Lastly, to submit an analysis.

## Results
The  rural cities had the lowest amount of rides and drivers but had the highest average fare per driver and average fare per ride. However it had the lowest total fares of the three cities by a substantial amount. The suburban cities were in the middle of the three for all of the metrics. Suburban cities had far more riders and drivers which dorve the total fares up by a lot as well. The urban cities had by far the highest number of riders and drivers. Even with the lowest fare per driver and fare per rider, urban cities had the high total fares by far. Below is an image of the dataframe.

The three lines that represent the three city types are clearly speperated and never cross each other. All three types of cities see a spike in total fares towards the end of Feb. Suburban cities seem to do better than the other two types of cities during the month of Apr. For rural cities, their peak of total fares is at the start of Apr. Urban cities looks like it has two spikes, one right before the start of Mar and the next one right after the start of Mar. Suburban cities has their spike towards the end of Feb as well. Below is the line chart depicting total fares by city type.

## Summary
It might be benneficial to take some of the drivers out of the rural and urban cities and put them in the suburban cities in the middle of Apr. Becasue suburban cities have a trend of their total fares going up in Apr while the other two types of cities have their trend declining. Try providing a small incentive for all drivers in all cities twoards the middle to the end of Feb. Each city type has a high peak for that time period and that should be capitalized on. At the start of Feb, take drivers out of rural and suburban cities and put them into urban cities. Try and keep the upwards trend of total fares in urban cities as strong as possible for that month.
